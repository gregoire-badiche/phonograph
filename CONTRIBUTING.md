## Coding Conventions

#### How to write code?

We primarily use JavaScript for this project.
Follow modern JavaScript best practices.
Code comments are appreciated.

#### How to debug code?

Since we use `stdout` to write the app, you can pipe `stderr` to a file and print your debug statements with `process.stderr.write(str)`, using `node src/app.js 2> output.txt` in the terminal to launch the app (in Linux)

## Commit Messages

Write clear and meaningful Git commit messages (they can be funny, but make it clear too)
Just need to know what you did

## Pull Requests

Ensure that your PRs are small, focused, and you clearly explain the changes made in the description.
